# FEUP-DA-PROJ1

First project for the DA course unit at FEUP.

A company wants to create an electronic crowdsourcing platform for deliveries.
They hire couriers for the normal deliveries and they have a van for the express deliveries.
In this project, we should develop algorithms to optimize different scenarios, such as:

- Use the minimum couriers possible while delivering the maximum orders
- Maximize the profit
- Minimize the average delivery time
